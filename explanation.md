lesson-10-if-statement.py

Explanation: code demonstrates the if statement, a fundamental control flow structure in Python. It allows  to conditionally execute code blocks based on whether a specified condition is true.

lesson-11-logical-operators.py

Explanation: This code explores logical operators (and, or, not) that combine conditions to create more complex decision-making logic.

lesson-12-comparison-operator.py

Explanation: This code focuses on comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) that compare values and return True or False based on the relationship between them.

lesson-13-while-loop.py

Explanation: This code introduces the while loop, which repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a condition remains true.

lesson-14-for-loop.py

Explanation: This code delves into the for loop, a convenient way to iterate over a sequence of items (like a list) and execute code for each element.

lesson-15-nested-loops.py

Explanation: This code showcases nested loops, where an inner loop iterates within an outer loop, enabling multi-dimensional processing.

lesson-16-lists.py

Explanation: This code explores lists, mutable ordered collections of items. You can access elements using indexing, modify elements, and perform various operations on them.

lesson-17-2d-list.py

Explanation: This code introduces two-dimensional lists (grids), representing data in rows and columns. You can access elements using row and column indices.

lesson-18-list-method.py

Explanation: This code explores built-in methods that provide convenient ways to manipulate lists. These methods offer functionality for adding, removing, sorting, searching, and more.

lesson-19-Unique.py

Explanation: This code likely delves into techniques for finding unique elements in a list. Common approaches include sets, list comprehensions with filtering, or the collections.Counter class.

lesson-20-tuple.py

Explanation: This code introduces tuples, immutable ordered collections of items similar to lists but cannot be modified after creation.

lesson-21-unpacking.py

Explanation: This code explores unpacking, a technique to assign multiple values from a collection (like a tuple or list) to variables in a single line.
